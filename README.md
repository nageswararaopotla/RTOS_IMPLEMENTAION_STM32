## 🧠 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the **implementation of FreeRTOS on an STM32 microcontroller** to efficiently manage multiple tasks running concurrently.  
The system is designed to handle real-time operations such as controlling **LEDs**, **fans**, and **motors**, ensuring synchronization and resource sharing through FreeRTOS mechanisms.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Integrate **FreeRTOS** into an STM32 microcontroller-based system.  
- Enable concurrent task execution for multiple hardware components.  
- Implement **task scheduling**, **synchronization**, and **resource management**.  
- Improve system efficiency and responsiveness in real-time environments.  
- Demonstrate the practical use of **RTOS concepts** in embedded systems.

## 🧩 Project Description

The project focuses on **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)** integration using **FreeRTOS** on the **STM32 platform**.  
The goal is to create a multitasking environment capable of running multiple operations simultaneously — such as blinking LEDs, controlling a cooling fan, and adjusting a DC motor — all without interference.

Each task runs independently but communicates and synchronizes using RTOS features like **mutexes**, **semaphores**, and **queues**, which help prevent resource conflicts.  
This ensures smooth operation, predictable timing, and optimized performance across all hardware modules.

## ⚙️ System Design

- **Processor:** STM32 (Cortex-M series)  
- **Operating System:** FreeRTOS  
- **Programming Language:** Embedded C  
- **Development Environment:** STM32CubeIDE  
- **Key Components:** LEDs, DC Motor, Fan, Sensors (Temperature/Speed)  

The RTOS manages individual tasks such as:
- LED blinking (indicating system activity)
- Fan control based on temperature input
- Motor speed adjustment using PWM signals
- Communication and synchronization through RTOS primitives

## 🧵 RTOS Concepts Used

### 🔸 Task Scheduling
Tasks are assigned different priorities to ensure time-critical operations are handled first.  
FreeRTOS uses a **preemptive scheduler**, enabling efficient CPU usage and responsive control.

### 🔸 Mutexes and Semaphores
Used to coordinate access to shared resources, ensuring no two tasks interfere with each other.  
For example, UART communication or sensor data access is protected by mutexes.

### 🔸 Inter-Task Communication
Data exchange between tasks is achieved using **queues** and **notifications**, allowing modular and scalable task interaction.
